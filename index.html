    <title>Debate Club - Is Reaper truly a villain?</title>

        <h4>Sophwest's Argument</h4>
        <p>I think Reaper is NOT a villain. He may have changed and started working for an evil enemy organization, but at his core he has his reasons and past traumas and events that lead him here. He is still Gabriel Reyes somewhere on the inside, and I think the right thing to do is to have sympathy for that broken old man. He was done dirty when he wasn't promoted to Strike Commander, and he is a vcitim of whatever experiments Moira did to him.</p>
        <p>The poor man might have a wife and child, I don't think he is inherently an evil villain, he's a victim of his life and the circumstances surrounding Overwatch. He nearly died in an explosion!!! If he was once a hero who fought for good, I don't think you can shake those convictions. I think just because he is working for an evil organization, it doesn't make him a villain. He's probably confused and in a lot of pain and running from demons. I personally would give him a hug.</p>
