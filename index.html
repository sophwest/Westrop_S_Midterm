    <h4>Sophbug's Argument</h4>
    <p>I think Reaper from Overwatch IS a villain. I think he's a villain because despite his past of being a hero as Gabriel Reyes, he switched sides and joined an enemy organization. This is betrayal to his former friends who fought alongside him, and a betrayal to the people who looked up to him and trusted him to fight for them and the world as part of Overwatch.</p>
    <p>Any excuse Reaper could give for joining the enemy is pointless, as someone who has now caused pain and suffering to innocent people he needs to be held accountable for his actions. He's literally committed crimes, and probably murder, so like that's really serious. I don't think it matters if he was ever "good", in my opinion he is now an irredeemable villain.</p>

        <h4>Sophwest's Argument</h4>
        <p>I think Reaper is NOT a villain. He may have changed and started working for an evil enemy organization, but at his core he has his reasons and past traumas and events that lead him here. He is still Gabriel Reyes somewhere on the inside, and I think the right thing to do is to have sympathy for that broken old man. He was done dirty when he wasn't promoted to Strike Commander, and he is a vcitim of whatever experiments Moira did to him.</p>
        <p>The poor man might have a wife and child, I don't think he is inherently an evil villain, he's a victim of his life and the circumstances surrounding Overwatch. He nearly died in an explosion!!! If he was once a hero who fought for good, I don't think you can shake those convictions. I think just because he is working for an evil organization, it doesn't make him a villain. He's probably confused and in a lot of pain and running from demons. I personally would give him a hug.</p>
