    <h4>Sophbug's Argument</h4>
    <p I think Reaper from Overwatch IS a villain. I think he's a villain because despite his past of being a hero as Gabriel Reyes, he switched sides and joined an enemy organization. This is betrayal to his former friends who fought alongside him, and a betrayal to the people who looked up to him and trusted him to fight for them and the world as part of Overwatch.</p>
    <p>Any excuse Reaper could give for joining the enemy is pointless, as someone who has now caused pain and suffering to innocent people he needs to be held accountable for his actions. He's literally committed crimes, and probably murder, so like that's really serious. I don't think it matters if he was ever "good", in my opinion he is now an irredeemable villain.</p>
