# Westrop_S_Midterm

MMED-1054 Midterm, completed with my partner who was horrible to work with, myself.
As proof of how horrible she was to work with, I have included a screenshot of the stuff she messed up in the img folder.
We argue whether Reaper from Overwatch is a villain or not. Sophwest takes the side that he isn't, and Sophbug takes the side that he is.
